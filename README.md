# Assistant - Alfred;

Alfred is a smart virtual assistant that lives on a twilio phone number

#How to get your own Alfred?

Just log into the Alfred's signup page, using your google account.
You will be assigned a new phone number, and guess what, that phone 
number is the address to your own personal Alfred.

Now that you have your own Alfred, you can use his phone number as a phone 
number of your own personal secretary.

Let people call Alfred and book meetings, events and what not. Never think about 
calendar scheduling anymore!
